# Contrast

Google Chrome accessibility extension to invert webpage colors, and reduce contrast ranges.

## Goals:

* Simplicity
  There are many similar extensions that offer contrast inversion, including [Deluminate](https://github.com/abstiles/deluminate) and [High Contrast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph?hl=en). However, this  extension aims to remain safe, simple, stable, and open-source accessible for readability and learning purposes.

* Accessibility
  The main purpose of this extension is to aid in the accessibility of webpages through contrast inversion. All webpages rendered will have contrast darkened for easier viewing.

## Timeline estimate:

1. June 15th

    Research Google Chrome extensions, and review developer documentation.
